For example, two traders, Adam and Bob, decide to trade a futures contract on the price of Bitcoin. Adam thinks the price of Bitcoin will go up in the next 30 days while Bob believes the price will go down. Both agree to enter into a position of 1 BTC  at the price of 5000 USD. Adam buys 1 BTC at 5000 USD (goes Long) from Bob who sells 1 BTC at 5000 USD (Bob goes Short). The terms of the contract are the following, if the price rises, Bob pays Adam, if the price drops, Adam pays Bob. After 30 days the price of Bitcoin is 5200 USD, which means that Adam made a profit on the trade of 200 USD, so now Bob pays the 200 USD to Adam. Notice that in this trade, no actual bitcoins were purchased or sold.</p>\n          </div>\n          <!--<div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-controls\">-->\n            <!--<e-button fill=\"white-bluebold\" size=\"s\" @click=\"openLink('https://help.ethermium.com/')\">Learn More</e-button>-->\n          <!--</div>-->\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          Who provides the price on the expiration day?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>For the deal to go through safely, Adam and Bob require a third party to provide the price of Bitcoin at the contract expiration date. Before entering into the deal Adam and Bob agree that the settlement price would be provided by a trusted exchange (e.g., Bitstamp.net), therefore at the expiration date, they would take the Bitcoin price from Bitstamp.net and use it to settle their agreement.</p>\n          </div>\n          <!--<div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-controls\">-->\n            <!--<e-button fill=\"white-bluebold\" size=\"s\" @click=\"$emit('depositWizard')\">Create New Wallet</e-button>-->\n            <!--<e-button fill=\"white-bluebold\" size=\"s\" @click=\"$emit('depositWizard')\">Log into an existing wallet</e-button>-->\n            <!--<e-button fill=\"white-bluebold\" size=\"s\" @click=\"$emit('depositWizard')\">Connect external wallet</e-button>-->\n          <!--</div>-->\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          How do Adam and Bob make sure that the loser will pay according to the agreement?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>To make sure that the winning party is repaid according to the conditions of the contract, both parties would place their funds in the custody of the third party that would act as the referee in the deal. Once the contract expires, the third party would take the price from the agreed price source and settle Adam's and Bob's account accordingly. DMEX runs a smart contract that holds the funds for Adam and Bob until the contract expires, on expiration collects the price from the agreed price source and settles both accounts. Neither Adam nor Bob have access to the funds while the contract is active. Creators of DMEX never have access to the user's funds.</p>\n          </div>\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          What is collateral?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>When Adam and Bob enter a position, they must lock the funds that would cover their respective loss. This way, everyone can be sure to get paid at the end of the contract. The locked funds are called collateral.</p>\n          </div>\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          What is \"leverage\"?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>In regular spot trading, if you have 5000 USD and the price of 1 BTC is 5000 USD you can only buy 1 BTC, however, in the case futures contracts, this is not necessarily true. Going back to the Adam and Bob example, where Adam buys 1 BTC and Bob sells 1 BTC at 5000 USD. Both will put forward the 5000 USD in collateral to cover the potential loss. If the price of BTC goes to zero, Adam will pay 5000 USD to Bob, is the price of BTC goes to 10 000 USD or above, Bob will pay Adam 5000 USD.</p>\n            <p>Let's now add a condition to the contract. Adam and Bob agree to enter opposite positions of 1 BTC at 5000$ with the contract having a Cap price of 5500$ and a Floor price of 4500$. This means that if the price of Bitcoin will go higher than 5500$, it will still be settled at 5500$ and if the price of 1 BTC goes lower than 4500$, it will still be settled at 4500$. This means that the maximum Loss for Adam and Bob is 500$ (5000$ - 4500$ for Adam and 5500$ - 5000$ for Bob). Therefore neither Adam nor Bob needs to provide more than 500$ (maximum possible loss) as collateral, meaning that to buy 5000$ worth of Bitcoin, both have to provide just 500$ (or 10 times less than the traded value). This is called 10x leverage. Similarly, Adam and Bob could agree to trade 10 BTC at 5000$ with 4500$-5500$ range, in which case both would provide 5000$ in collateral.</p>\n            <p>By reducing the range of the contract, the leverage can be increased. For example, consider the same trade with a range of 4900$-5100$. Both traders need to provide 100$ collateral for each BTC they buy/sell at the price of 5000$, thus using 50x leverage (5000$ / 100$).</p>\n            <p>Leverage allows the trader to profit from the full amount traded while providing just a fraction as collateral. So if Adam uses 5000$ as collateral in this trade, he can buy 50 BTC worth 250 000$ worth of bitcoin (at 50x leverage). If the price goes up to 5050, Adam will make 50$ * 50 BCT = 2500$ (while providing only 100 USD as collateral).</p>\n            <p><span class=\"the-main-faq__attention \">* Attention</span>: Leveraged trading is dangerous, and you run the risk of losing all your collateral. The higher the leverage, the higher the risk. Be careful and never use as collateral more than you can afford to lose.</p>\n          </div>\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          How Adam and Bob find each other?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>DMEX operates as an exchange and provides an order book. Both Adam and Bob would enter DMEX, select the asset, expiration date and the leverage level (in our case BTCUSD and 10x leverage) and place their respective orders: Adam would place a buy order for 1 BTC at 5000$ and Bob would place a sell order for 1 BTC at 5000$. Because the price of the orders matches, DMEX would instantly match them and open a position for each trader:</p>\n            <p>\n              - for Adam a Long position of 1 BTC with an entry price of 5000$\n              <br>\n              - for Bob a Short position of 1 BTC with an entry price of 5000$\n            </p>\n            <p>The positions will be settled once the contract expires or any of the traders decide to exit the position early through a reverse order.</p>\n          </div>\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          How does Adam exit his position earlier than the settlement date?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>Let's imagine Adam wishes to exit his position before the expiration of the contract. Adam has an open Long position of 1 BTC at an entry price of 5000$. The current price of bitcoin is at 5050$ and Adam decides he wishes to take the 50$ profit without waiting for the contract to expire. Adam places an order to sell 1 BTC at 5050$. Carl is another trader who wants to enter a Long position (buy) of 1 BTC at 5050$. Carl places a buy order for 1 BTC at 5050$ (with 550$ as collateral 5050$ - 4500$ floor price), and his order is instantly matched with Adam's sell order. Adam's position is now closed and his collateral released. Adam made a 50$ profit on his 500$ collateral (a nice 10% gain). Carl now has an open Long position for 1 BTC at 5050$ and Bob's position has remained the same.</p>\n          </div>\n        </template>\n      </e-main-faq-item>\n\n      <e-main-faq-item class=\"the-main-faq__list-item\">\n        <template slot=\"question\">\n          How Adam and Bob make sure the price posted at the settlement date is correct?\n        </template>\n        <template slot=\"response\">\n          <div class=\"the-main-faq__list-item-response-text\">\n            <p>Every traded asset on DMEX has the pricing source set up in the smart contract. Before placing an order, the trader can check the URL where the price will be taken on the expiration date. Once the expiration date comes, the price will be fetched by an Oracle. The Oracle is a decentralized third party that provides the contents of a given URL. In our case, the URL will contain the price of the underlying asset. On the settlement date, the DMEX contract will call the Oracle contract requesting the data from the price URL. The Oracle contract will fetch the data from the URL and call the DMEX contract providing this data along with the proof that the data was fetched safely.</p>\n            <p>DMEX uses Provable (https://provable.xyz/) as it's Oracle.

Different futures contracts can allow for different collateral currencies. The collateral currency will usually be the blockchain currency (ETH for the Ethereum Blockchain) or another token like a stable coin (ex. TUSD, which is pegged 1:1 to USD). The profit on the trade is also paid in the base currency. This means that if you trade a BTCUSD contract with ETH as the base currency, the collateral for the trade and profit will be paid in ETH. The amount of ETH will be calculated based on the price of ETH at the time of settlement.
